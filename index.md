### Legal text analytics: clustering trends in r/legaladvice using tfidf and k-means with pca visualization
I analyzed posts from r/legaladvice to identify common legal trends using Python libraries like Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn. A TF-IDF matrix and K-Means clustering were used to uncover key topics, which were visualized with PCA to highlight trends in rental issues, car-related concerns, and work/finance topics.

### Legal text analytics: clustering trends in r/legaladvice using tfidf and k-means with pca visualization
I analyzed posts from r/legaladvice to identify common legal trends using Python libraries like Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn. A TF-IDF matrix and K-Means clustering were used to uncover key topics, which were visualized with PCA to highlight trends in rental issues, car-related concerns, and work/finance topics.

### Golf score simulation: predicting future performance using normal distribution and monte carlo simulations
I used my personal golf scores to simulate potential future performances using Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. By applying a Normal Distribution and running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, I generated a range of possible scores for upcoming rounds. The simulations were visualized to highlight trends in score variability, and to help me understand the likelihood of breaking specific score thresholds like 80 or 90.
